/**
   Examples of good candidates for structures include:
 
 - The size of a geometric shape, perhaps encapsulating a width property and a height property, both of type Double.
 - A way to refer to ranges within a series, perhaps encapsulating a start property and a length property, both of type Int.
 - A point in a 3D coordinate system, perhaps encapsulating x, y and z properties, each of type Double.
